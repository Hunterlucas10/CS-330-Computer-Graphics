How do I approach designing software?
I start by understanding the user’s needs and planning out the flow and structure of the software. I focus on keeping it simple and user-friendly.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My project has helped me improve wireframing, planning out user experience, and ensuring accessibility.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started with sketches, then built wireframes and mockups. I prioritized the user flow and got feedback before finalizing the design.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can apply the same planning and feedback process in future projects to make sure the design meets user needs and is easy to navigate.

How do I approach developing programs?
I begin by understanding the requirements, breaking down the tasks, and focusing on clear, manageable steps. I try to keep the code clean and simple.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene, I used more modular development, dividing the work into smaller parts and focusing on one thing at a time.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration helped me refine the project. I made adjustments after testing and feedback to improve functionality and design.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach has become more methodical. I now break things into smaller, manageable tasks, test frequently, and refine as I go.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me by giving me the skills to solve complex problems, automate tasks, and improve processes, which are all key to achieving my career goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics teach me how to represent data visually and understand complex systems, which is valuable for both school projects and professional work in tech.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics help me build skills in visual problem-solving and communication, which are important in many tech fields, including software development and design.
